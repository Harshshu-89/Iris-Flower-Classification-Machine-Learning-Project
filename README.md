# Iris Flower Classification Machine Learning Project

# Introduction About Project
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset for Machine Learning project.

# Three classes for classification of 'Irsi flowers ':

* Iris-setosa
* Iris-versicolor
* Iris-virginica


# Tools
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

# Libraries
* Pandas
* plotly
* Numpy
* Matpoltlib
* Scikit Learn

# Machine Learning Model
 * DecisionTreeClassifier Model

# Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, which can be one of three possible values: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.


# Conclusion
In this project, we used the powerful algorithms to train our data. Processing of data
is also important to acquire the best result they are very satisfactory. The accuracy score of models are very good and they can be used to
predict the species of iris flower. As we can conclude that in future with appropriate data of features of any flower it
is possible to classify the species of any flower.
